## Overview
In this exercise I'll be using Tableau to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company. To support this proposal I'll be analyzing data from the Citi Bike program in New York City to visualize metrics such as Trip Duration, Customer Gender, & Station Latitude/Longitude among others to gather insights and support my proposal.

## Results

- The Vast majority of Trips are less than 30 minutes

- Males are 3 times more likely to use a bikeshare than Females

- Bikekeshare utilization is clustered at rush hour during the weekdays and more evenly distributed during the weekend

- Males and Females share the same pattern of utililisation when analyzed at the hour level, with Males showing higher rates of overall utilization

- Bikeshare Subscribers of all genders use the the bikes significantly more than more casual non-subscription users

## Summary

#### In Conclusion, the tight clustering of starting & ending locations as well as the average trip durations for rides demonstrates that placement of bikeshares at strategic points in the city, i.e. tourist attractions & densely populated work/office areas within a relatively small geographical area is an integral strategy for generating high utilization. Because males use bikeshares more that females they are a target demographic in terms of marketing, additionally- there is a window of opportunity in the female demographic to increase utilization as well. Segmentation will be import.

#### Managers of the program should also pay special attention to logistics and ensure availability of bikeshare during morning & evening rush-hours to avoid losing customers due to lack of available bikes at peak usage times.

#### The following additional visualization might also be helpful for the dataset:
- Average trip duration by birth year might provide valuable insights on customer segmentation by age
- A Heatmap of usage amounts sorted by bike would help inform possible maintenance trends and budgeting
